### MultiSwap Clause

If you don't use our deployed factories to create derived contracts, then you must make an arrangement
for some fees to get allocated to MultiSwap Finance. There are many ways to do this, and it is trivial to add this
requirement to any setup. We will have some predefined configurations shortly that automatically satisfy
this exception. But for now, if you don't use the factories, then contact us.
